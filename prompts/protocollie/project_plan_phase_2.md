2. **Window Startup Size**: Increased default window from 800x600 to 1400x900
   - Ensures three-panel layout is properly visible on startup
   - Added minimum constraints (1000x700) for optimal usability

These fixes significantly improve the developer experience and form the foundation for the remaining Phase 2a stories.

## Known Issues & Bugs

### Bug 2.B1: Server Connection UI State Sync Issue
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** When clicking on a disconnected server in the left panel, the main content shows "Server not connected" message. When clicking the "Connect" button and the server successfully connects, the UI doesn't refresh to show the connected state and tool list.

**Expected Behavior:** After successful connection, the main content should automatically refresh to show the server's tools and update the left panel to reflect the connected state.

**Impact:** Users must manually refresh or click elsewhere to see the connected server's tools, breaking the expected workflow.

---

### Bug 2.B2: Quick Access Panel Auto-Update Missing
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** When executing tools on a connected server, the Quick Access panel (recent tools, favorites) doesn't automatically update to reflect the new execution.

**Expected Behavior:** The Quick Access panel should immediately update to show:
- Recently used tools list with the newly executed tool at the top
- Updated usage counts and last-used timestamps
- Real-time synchronization with tool execution activity

**Impact:** Developers don't see their recent activity reflected in the Quick Access panel until they manually refresh or restart the application, reducing the panel's utility for workflow acceleration.

---

### Bug 2.B3: Adding new server disconnects existing servers
**Priority:** High
**Description:** When adding a new MCP server while there are existing connected servers, all previously connected servers get disconnected.

**Expected Behavior:** Adding a new server should not affect the connection status of existing servers.

**Impact:** Disruptive to workflow when managing multiple servers simultaneously. Forces users to reconnect all servers after adding a new one.

---

**Note:** These bugs will be addressed in a future maintenance sprint once the core Phase 2 features are complete.
