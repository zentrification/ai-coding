# Protocollie - Architecture & Design Document

## Overview

Protocollie is a desktop application built with Tauri 2.0 that serves as a comprehensive testing and exploration tool for Model Context Protocol servers. Similar to Postman for APIs, it allows developers to connect to multiple MCP servers, explore their capabilities, and test their functionality in real-time.

## Target Users

Protocollie is designed for **MCP server developers**, **AI/LLM integration engineers**, and **technical product managers** who need to rapidly prototype, test, and debug MCP implementations. Just as early Postman users were API developers tired of using curl commands, Protocollie serves developers building AI-powered tools who need a professional interface to understand what MCP servers expose, test tool calls with complex arguments, and validate responses before integrating them into production applications.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri 2.0
- **MCP Integration**: Direct system Node.js processes with JSON-RPC protocol
- **Node.js Runtime**: System Node.js (users have Node.js installed as MCP developers)
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach (SQLite + in-memory + JSON)
- **IPC**: Tauri's command system + direct process stdin/stdout communication

### Architecture Decision Rationale

We chose to use direct system Node.js processes instead of bundled sidecars or Rust MCP implementations for several key reasons:

1. **Target Audience Alignment**: MCP developers already have Node.js installed for most MCP servers (`npx`, `npm` packages)
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Direct process spawning is simpler than complex sidecar coordination and bundling
3. **Universal Command Support**: Works with any MCP server type - `npx`, `python`, `ruby`, custom binaries
4. **Real-world Usage**: Matches how developers actually run MCP servers in development and production
5. **Enhanced Error Messaging**: Can provide specific guidance for missing dependencies with installation instructions

## Backend Design

### Core Components

#### 1. MCP Process Manager (Rust)
See `mcp_process.rs` for implementation. Key methods:
- `MCPProcess::start(command, args)` - Spawn MCP server with stdio pipes
- `send_initialize()` - MCP protocol handshake
- `execute_mcp_tool(tool_name, arguments)` - Execute tools via JSON-RPC
- `list_mcp_tools()` - Discover available tools
- Enhanced Node.js detection with helpful error messages

#### 2. Global Process Registry  
See `mcp_process.rs:279` - Central management using `HashMap<String, MCPProcess>`

#### 3. Tauri Commands
See `server_commands.rs` for all Tauri command implementations:
- `connect_server()`, `disconnect_server()` - Server lifecycle
- `list_tools()`, `execute_tool()` - Tool operations  
- `add_server()`, `update_server()`, `delete_server()` - Configuration management

#### 4. Data Storage Layer
See `db.rs` for SQLite implementation with servers, history, collections, and preferences tables.

### Distribution Strategy

**No bundling required:**
- Application uses system Node.js directly
- No platform-specific binaries to generate or maintain
- Smaller app distribution size
- Simpler build process

**System requirements:**
- Node.js installed for Node.js-based MCP servers (`node`, `npx` commands)
- Python installed for Python-based MCP servers
- Other runtimes as needed by specific MCP servers

**User guidance:**
- Clear error messages when dependencies are missing
- Installation instructions for Node.js/Python/other runtimes
- Links to official installation guides
- Platform-specific package manager commands

## Frontend Design

### Component Structure
See `src/components/` for implementation:
- `ui/` - Reusable UI primitives (Modal, Button, Input, Card, ErrorBoundary)
- `forms/` - Form-specific components with validation logic (AddServerForm, EditServerForm)
- `layout/` - Layout and navigation components:
  - `Layout` - Three-panel layout structure with resizable panels
  - `Header` - Enhanced header with branding, theme toggle, and navigation
  - `Sidebar` - Sectioned navigation with server management
  - `MainContent` - Dynamic content area with breadcrumb navigation and contextual rendering
  - `ToolSelector` - Tool selection dropdown with search and filtering
  - `ToolDisplay` - Tool execution interface with parameter forms
  - `RightPanel` - Contextual information panel (expandable for future features)
- `hooks/` - Custom hooks for state management and side effects
- `types/` - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

## Theme System & UI Architecture

### Custom Theme Implementation
- **System**: Custom `.light` class-based theming (not Tailwind's default `dark:` system)
- **Provider**: React context with `useTheme()` hook provides `resolvedTheme` ('light'|'dark')
- **CSS Variables**: Light theme overrides in `App.css` change Tailwind class colors via CSS variables
- **Theme Toggle**: Automatic system preference detection with manual override capability

### Theme-Aware Component Patterns
Components requiring theme support should:
1. Import `useTheme()` hook: `import { useTheme } from '../../hooks/useTheme'`
2. Get resolved theme: `const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme()`
3. Create conditional styling functions that return appropriate classes for each theme
4. **Avoid `dark:` prefixes** - they don't work with the custom theme system

### Recent Theme Fixes (Story 3.1)
- **ServerCard**: Fixed selection highlighting readability in light mode
- **HelpModal**: Fixed code/kbd element readability in dark mode  
- **Badge Component**: Removed incompatible `dark:` prefixes
- **Error Display**: Unified theme-neutral error colors for both light/dark modes
- **CSS Coverage**: Enhanced gray class overrides for broader theme compatibility

## Appendix: What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

### Key MCP Concepts:

**MCP Servers** are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (tools, prompts, and resources) through the protocol. For example, a Git MCP server might expose tools like `git_status`, `git_commit`, and `git_diff` that an LLM can call.

**MCP Clients** are applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that connect to MCP servers to access their capabilities. They maintain 1:1 connections with servers.

**Core Primitives:**
- **Resources**: Data and content that servers expose (files, documents, live data)
- **Tools**: Functions that LLMs can execute through the server (API calls, system commands, calculations)
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates and workflows
- **Sampling**: Allows servers to request LLM completions

**Transport Layers**: MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:
- **stdio**: Communication through standard input/output (for local processes)
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: For HTTP-based connections
- **WebSocket**: For bidirectional streaming (planned)

The protocol enables LLMs to interact with external systems in a controlled, secure way while maintaining clear boundaries between the AI model and the tools/data it accesses. This standardization means developers can write MCP servers once and have them work with any MCP-compatible client, similar to how REST APIs work with any HTTP client.
